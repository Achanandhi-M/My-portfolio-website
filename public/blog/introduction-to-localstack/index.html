<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>What is LocalStack? why do we need it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>LocalStack is a Free and Open Source</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>According to LocalStack Docs,</strong> <a href="https://localstack.cloud">LocalStack</a> is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider!</p>
<p>In simple terms, we can run AWS services in our Local Environment, without the need to pay a single dollar for using the service. We can get an exact clone of AWS in LocalStack, and see how amazing it is, we can use LocalStack for testing our cloud apps locally on our computers.</p>

<p><strong><em>This Meme is just to Explain its purpose</em></strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/my-demo-portfolio/static/blogs/localstack-02.jpeg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Everyone has this Question, why do we need LocalStack?<strong>ü§î</strong> See the basic problem the LocalStack solves is we can test our entire cloud apps locally, if we want to test in AWS cloud, we have to pay for them, And also it takes more time, so we don&rsquo;t want that right, In LocalStack we can test our services within seconds or minutes.

<p><strong>2 . is LocalStack is alternative to AWS</strong>‚ùì</p>
<p>One thing I want to mention here guys, LocalStack and AWS has different use cases, don&rsquo;t think LocalStack is an alternative to AWS. AWS is the king of the cloud computing world, there offers nearly 200+ services. LocalStack has use cases where u can develop and test the AWS cloud.</p>

<p>Currently, LocalStack supports AWS cloud only, I don&rsquo;t know what about the other cloud, Maybe in the future they develop for other cloud providers as well. <strong><em>LocalStack: Your AWS Ally in Local Development</em></strong>.</p>

<p>As everyone knows AWS is updating their services every day, is any update happens in AWS services it will soon also replicate in LocalStack as well, Don&rsquo;t Worry about that.</p>
