In 2006, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a way to provide cloud computing services to businesses🏢 and individuals.\nAbout Today Blog post:\nOverview of AWS.\nList of Services from AWS.\nFree Resources to learn AWS.\nUse Chatgpt for Learning.\nOverview of AWS\nAWS is one of the widely used cloud computing☁️ platforms. It offers a vast array of services that enable businesses, developers, and individuals to build🏗️ and deploy applications, store🫙 and manage data, and leverage powerful💪 computing resources on a pay-as-you-go💵 basis.\nList of Services from AWS\nInitially, AWS offered basic services like storage🫙 and computing power, but it quickly expanded its offerings to include various other services, such as databases, networking, and developer tools. As of now, AWS is providing 200+ services for various use cases, choose the best one that suits your business.\nAmazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides virtual servers in the cloud, allowing users to scale computing resources as needed.\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable object storage for storing and retrieving data, often used for backup, static website hosting, and data archiving.\nAWS Lambda(Serverless): Allows users to run code without provisioning or managing servers, enabling serverless computing and event-driven architectures.\nAmazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service supporting various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\nAmazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service that offers high scalability, low latency, and automatic scaling.\nAmazon CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) for fast and secure delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs.\nAmazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Enables users to create an isolated virtual network in the cloud and launch AWS resources within it, providing enhanced security and control.\nAmazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): A messaging service for sending push notifications to mobile devices, email notifications, and more.\nAmazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Fully managed message queuing service for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.\nAWS S3 Glacier: Low-cost storage service for long-term data archiving and backup purposes.\nAmazon ECS(Elastic Container Service):ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run and scale containerized applications.\nAmazon EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service): Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters.\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more AWS services available to cater to various needs such as machine learning, analytics, security, IoT, and more.\nYou can also use Cloud Environment for running🏃‍♂️ your Machine learning models and also u can deploy our machine learning models into the cloud.☁️\nAmazon Sage maker is the famous ML Service offered by AWS. It simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying ML models at scale.📈\nThe tech industry growing day by day, Last month “AWS announced” Amazon Bedrock and Amazon CodeWhisperer. Amazon CodeWhisperer is like an alternative to GitHub Copilot it can write code for you in your code editor, U can use it for free🆓 of cost, and u can also perform security scans in your code. If you want to try it out click this link\nFree Resources for Learning AWS\nAWS Skill Builder - A learning platform designed by AWS, for learning cloud. By signing up, you get free access to 500+ courses available.\nAWS Free tier-Experiment and practice with AWS at no cost. The Free Tier provides limited free access to a range of AWS services.\nAWS Cloud Quest- cloud quest is an interactive game-based learning experience that guides your cloud career development. After finishing you will receive a quest badge and an offer for writing an AWS Cloud partitioner exam, considered one of the basic level certification exams in the cloud industry.\nApart from that, AWS also offerings many workshops and live training you can also make use of it.\nUse Chatgpt for Learning🏫\nYou can also use some other AI tools for learning cloud and other stuff. Chatgpt is the best one among other AI tools, but the main drawback is that it has Limited knowledge😓 of the world and events after 2021. If you want to learn new tools or technology u can use their own documentation for learning. Chatgpt is one kind of superpower💪, if you know how to use it then you are the master. In my next⏭️ blog, I can explain how u can use Chatgpt for learning, how u can use Chatgpt for fixing bugs🪲, how Chatgpt helps other domains, And also the dark 😈side of Chatgpt. See you Next in Blog😊. Happy Learning📖\n",
