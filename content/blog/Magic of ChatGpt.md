Hi friends, welcome back to Blogs-with-Achu. I believe we are currently experiencing the next revolution ➡️ **the AI 🤖Revolution**. The excitement surrounding AI has escalated significantly following the release of ChatGpt by OpenAI.

**In Today's Blog:**

- What exactly is AI?🤔

- The marvels of ChatGpt and how it can assist you?🫂

- Real-Time Examples📔

**What exactly is AI**🤖

Imagine a world🌍 where machines could think🤔, learn, and even outsmart us, humans. Fascinating, right? Well, that's the magic🪄 of AI. AI is a system that thinks and acts like a human. In simple terms, AI is all about teaching computers🖥️ to think and learn in ways similar to ours. AI systems learn from data. Data plays a vital role in creating AI. It uses techniques like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other methods to develop AI systems.

**The marvels of ChatGpt and how it can assist you?**🫂

**ChatGpt** is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. ChatGpt (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is like having a super-smart AI friend who loves to chat and entertain. With ChatGpt, you can ask questions, share stories, and even have it write blogs, essays, and code. You can also utilize it for debugging your code.

However, ChatGpt is not limited to specific use cases like coding. It has a wide range of applications. You can harness its superpower for learning math, commerce, business, medicine, and much more. It can even teach you advanced concepts in various fields.

Remember, ChatGpt has a huge volume of data stored🫙 in the backend, most likely in the ☁️cloud. The crucial aspect of using ChatGpt effectively lies in how you interact with it. So, how can you ask questions in a way that ensures ChatGpt understands and generates easily understood responses?

You will become a master in using ChatGpt once you know how to ask questions. It's similar to how we use Google: we type in the search bar what we are looking for. The same principle applies to ChatGpt, with the difference being that Google is a search engine while ChatGpt engages in human-like conversations(chat bot).

  
**_No need to worry if it sounds complicated! Let's make understanding ChatGpt easy and fun by exploring some examples together🙌. If you're already using this incredible superpower, feel free to share your experiences and tips in the comments section below._** 👇

**Real time Examples**📔

If you're a new user and haven't tried ChatGpt yet, [**_click the link_**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to use ChatGpt. ChatGpt has two version

1. GPT-3.5 version(free version )
    - The GPT-3.5 version is free to use, which is sufficient for normal users. However, it has limitations in that it can only generate text-based outputs and does not support image generation. The responses generated by GPT-3.5 are typically in text format.

3. GPT-4 version (paid version)🤑
    - On the other hand, the GPT-4 version is an upgraded model with enhanced capabilities. It can work with images and can generate images as well. Additionally, the response time is faster compared to the previous version. However, using the GPT-4 version requires a subscription fee of approximately $20 per month, which is equivalent to around 1650 Indian rupees.

**_Note: ChatGpt has limited information available up until September 2021. I may not have the latest or most up-to-date information._**🥲

Now you can see the output it generated - The responses are saved in the left panel⬅️ you can in the left side👈, the responses are auto-saved you don't need to save them manually, it is autosaved and stored in the cloud. If the responses generated are not good, it still confusing you can also regenerate using the regenerate response.

**_Pro-Tips: Ask questions like "Explain it for age 5", "Explain in simple terms", and "Explain it with simple examples ". Remember if you misspelled the word "Economics," ChatGpt still generates the correct output. So don't worry about mistakes, ChatGpt can still generate correct output._**

In the above example, I asked ChatGpt to explain economics to a 5-year-old, and it magically generated a response that was easy to understand. It's truly a magical experience! Try it out for yourself and let me know in the comments section how your experience was while working with ChatGpt.

**Note: ChatGpt is not limited to specific areas. I am just showcasing examples in certain fields to demonstrate its capabilities.**

**ChatGpt can Write Code**👨‍💻

**For computer science students, writing code is an important task. ChatGpt can assist in generating code, and it does so in a way that is easy to understand.**
