Hi friendsüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è welcome back to Blogs-with-Achu. I am back with exciting news and an announcement from AWS re:Invent 2023.

If you are coming across the AWS re:Invent event for the first time, **note that it is one of the largest cloud computing events in the world**. AWS customers, partners, developers, and cloud enthusiasts gather to learn about the latest advancements in cloud technology, share experiences, and network with others in the industry.

This event occurs annually; this time, the event happened in Las Vegas. There are many new AWS Services announced in the fields of Machine Learning, Storage, Compute, Analytics, etc.

Among these announcements, my favorite one is **Amazon Q (A new generative AI-powered assistant)**.

Amazon Q can help business users complete tasks using simple natural language prompts. Apart from business tasks it also helps us in learning AWS services. The best part about Amazon Q is it can also be useful for troubleshooting and solving issues directly in the console.

Amazon Q Trained on 17 years of AWS knowledge and best practices, Amazon Q is designed to help you at each stage of development with a new experience for building applications on AWS. You can also use Amazon Q to write code for your simple web applications, and you can ask Amazon Q to suggest the best and cost-optimized AWS services for hosting simple web Applications, based on your request it will suggest the service.

In our next blog, we will be seeing how we can integrate Amazon Q in our VS code Environment. Stay engaged with me for upcoming re:Invent announcements that I'll be sharing.

Regards
