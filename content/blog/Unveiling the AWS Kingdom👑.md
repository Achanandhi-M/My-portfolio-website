Welcome,üëãfolks! I think every one of you heard about AWS(Amazon Web Services). In 2006, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a way to provide cloud computing services to businessesüè¢ and individuals.

**Overview of AWS**

AWS is one of the widely used cloud computing‚òÅÔ∏è platforms. It offers a vast array of services that enable businesses, developers, and individuals to buildüèóÔ∏è and deploy applications, storeü´ô and manage data, and leverage powerfulüí™ computing resources on a pay-as-you-goüíµ basis.

**List of Services from AWS**

Initially, AWS offered basic services like storageü´ô and computing power, but it quickly expanded its offerings to include various other services, such as databases, networking, and developer tools. As of now, AWS is providing 200+ services for various use cases, choose the best one that suits your business.

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides virtual servers in the cloud, allowing users to scale computing resources as needed.

- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable object storage for storing and retrieving data, often used for backup, static website hosting, and data archiving.

- **AWS Lambda(Serverless):** Allows users to run code without provisioning or managing servers, enabling serverless computing and event-driven architectures.

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational database service supporting various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed NoSQL database service that offers high scalability, low latency, and automatic scaling.

- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network (CDN) for fast and secure delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs.

- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Enables users to create an isolated virtual network in the cloud and launch AWS resources within it, providing enhanced security and control.

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: A messaging service for sending push notifications to mobile devices, email notifications, and more.

- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):** Fully managed message queuing service for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

- **AWS S3 Glacier:** Low-cost storage service for long-term data archiving and backup purposes.

- **Amazon ECS(Elastic Container Service)**:ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run and scale containerized applications.

- **Amazon EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more AWS services available to cater to various needs such as machine learning, analytics, security, IoT, and more.

**Use Chatgpt for Learning**üè´

You can also use some other AI tools for learning cloud and other stuff. Chatgpt is the best one among other AI tools, but the main drawback is that it has Limited knowledgeüòì of the world and events after 2021. If you want to learn new tools or technology u can use their own documentation for learning. Chatgpt is one kind of superpowerüí™, if you know how to use it then you are the master. In my next‚è≠Ô∏è blog, I can explain how u can use Chatgpt for learning, how u can use Chatgpt for fixing bugsü™≤, how Chatgpt helps other domains, And also the dark üòàside of Chatgpt. See you Next in Blogüòä. Happy Learningüìñ
