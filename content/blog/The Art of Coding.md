Hi friends, welcome back to Blogs-with-Achu. In my previous blog👈, I mentioned how you can use AI 🤖to upskill, and I also showcased some examples of how you can use ChatGpt for learning📖 Have you ever wondered🤔 how these technologies are developed and which programming language is used to build them? In today's blog, we will explore the programming languages that underpin these cutting-edge innovations.

**In Today's Blog:**

- What is a programming language why it is needed?

- Python🐍 for AI

- Writing our First program1️⃣

**What is a Programming language?**

Imagine you have a robot 🤖friend. To make your robot friend do things, you need to give it instructions. You can't just say, "Robot, do something!" because the robot won't know what to do. So, you need to speak the robot's language, which is the programming language.

Programming languages are needed because computers👨‍💻 are really smart, but they can't understand our regular human language. So, when people write programs using a programming language, they are writing a special set of instructions that the computer can understand. These instructions tell the computer what to do step by step, like playing a game or solving a math problem.

**_In simple words, a programming language is like a secret code that helps us talk to computers and make them do cool things!_**

**Python for AI**

Python🐍 is a popular language because it's easy to read and write. It's like speaking in a way that both humans and computers can understand. It's a bit like talking 🗣️to a friend. You can say things like "print 'Hello!'" and the computer💻 will show the word "Hello!" on the screen.

Python has gained immense popularity as the language of choice for AI development. Python offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for AI and machine learning tasks. Popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn provide robust functionality, simplifying complex AI tasks.

Python has a large⚡ and active community of developers who contribute to open-source AI projects, provide comprehensive tutorials, and offer support.

  
The choice of choosing programming language depends on the technology and the specific requirements of the project.

**Writing our First Program**

I use VSCodium, a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE), for writing code. In VSCodium, you can write code in various programming languages. It is free and open-source software. [](https://vscodium.com/) [_Use this link to install VSCodium._](https://vscodium.com/)

In the above ⬆️example, I have written a simple "Hello World" program, which is commonly used by programmers to start learning a new programming language.

I created a file called "helloworld.py" (you can give any Filename) and wrote just one line of code: `**print('Hello World')**`. This line of code will print "Hello World" in the terminal.

Running a Python🐍 file in the terminal is simple. You can use the command `**python yourFilename.py**`, and it will execute the code and display the output in the terminal.

Writing code in Python is similar to having a conversation with a 🚹human. It is easy to learn and understand. This is just an overview of Python, and in my next blog, we will delve into a detailed overview. Stay tuned and Happy learning!
